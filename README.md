**v0.5.0 shipped — TRIDENT.** The ESP32-C5 companion satellite is now a proper peripheral over ESP-NOW. POSEIDON's Cardputer-Adv is 2.4 GHz-only; TRIDENT adds **5 GHz deauth** (bypasses `ieee80211_raw_frame_sanity_check` via a direct binary patch to `libnet80211.a`), **802.15.4 Zigbee sniffing**, and **5 GHz PMKID capture** — features the S3 physically can't do. LoRa is now fully working end-to-end on the CAP-LoRa1262 hat (canonical SX1262 init, shared HSPI with SD, proper BUSY pin). Every scan / live screen is flicker-free: `ui_draw_status`, wifi_scan, ble_scan, wifi_clients, wifi_spectrum, and the c5 dashboards all cache state and only repaint on actual change. bmorcelli Launcher support ships as a second PIO env (`cardputer-launcher`) that links into the `ota_0` slot at 0x170000. Full breakdown in [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

**TRIDENT web flasher** — ESP32-C5 isn't in M5Burner's chip list, so we put a one-click WebSerial flasher straight in the docs. Plug the C5 in, hit a button, done. Manual `esptool` + full ESP-IDF build-from-source instructions also live there.

## What is this?

POSEIDON is a pentesting firmware for the M5Stack Cardputer-Adv (ESP32-S3). 95+ features across WiFi, BLE, sub-GHz, 2.4 GHz, LoRa, IR, network attacks, and more. In the same family as Flipper Zero, Bruce, Evil-M5Project, and ESP32Marauder — but built around a **real keyboard** with letter mnemonics, typed parameters, three swappable visual themes, and a procedural ambient layer painted behind every menu.

Supports four hardware hats (one at a time):
- **M5Stack CAP-LoRa1262** — LoRa (SX1262) + GNSS (GPS)
- **PINGEQUA Hydra RF Cap 424** — CC1101 sub-GHz + nRF24L01+ 2.4 GHz
- **ESP32-C5 companion node** — 5 GHz WiFi + Zigbee via ESP-NOW mesh
- **W5500 SPI → Ethernet** — wired RJ45 for full RaspyJack / SaltyJack parity (DHCP starve, rogue DHCP, Responder, WPAD, NTLM harvest) over a LAN cable instead of WiFi STA

## Quick Start

### Planned: MIMIR Drop-Box (future)

**MIMIR** is a companion pentest drop-box targeting a **Banana Pi BPI-M4 Zero** (Allwinner H618, 4GB RAM). Design goal: POSEIDON connects via USB-C as the pocket-mode control client — no wireless link, pure opsec. MIMIR would run autonomous handshake hunting, cracking, and post-exploitation while the Cardputer stays the interactive UI. **Not implemented yet — aspirational roadmap item, no client code in POSEIDON today.**

| Display | Waveshare 4" Spectra 6 e-ink (640x400) |
| Sidecar | DAVEY JONES (ESP32-C6 + SX1262 LoRa) |
| Control | POSEIDON Cardputer via USB-CDC |

## Roadmap

Full release history in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Current shipped version is **v0.5.0** (TRIDENT + LoRa + flicker fixes + M5 Launcher support). What's next:

The nRF52840 is the real BLE chip — full BLE 5.0 with long range, coded PHY, and direction finding. Adding it as a USB-connected sniffer module.

- [ ] nRF52840 dongle as BLE sniffer (USB-CDC bridge from Cardputer)
- [ ] Full BLE advertisement capture + decode (not just nRF24 fake-BLE)
- [ ] BLE connection hijacking (MITM via nRF52 + NimBLE coordination)
- [ ] BLE direction finding (AoA/AoD with multi-antenna nRF52)
- [ ] BLE long-range attacks (Coded PHY S=8, 4x range)

### Aspirational — MIMIR Drop-Box (BPI-M4 Zero)
**Not started.** A future companion pentest drop-box on a Banana Pi BPI-M4 Zero running `hcxdumptool` + on-device cracker + Bjorn orchestrator. POSEIDON would act as the pocket-mode USB-C control client. No code exists today.

- [ ] MIMIR daemon: `hcxdumptool` wrapper
- [ ] On-device WPA2 dictionary cracker (dual-core PBKDF2-SHA1)
- [ ] Bjorn orchestrator port — handshake → crack → auto-exploit pivot
- [ ] FENRIR RL policy head — autonomous exploit strategy selection
- [ ] Armbian H618 image recipe (one-flash deploy)
- [ ] MIMIR ↔ POSEIDON file transfer
- [ ] GPS-tagged attack logging with WiGLE integration

- [ ] On-device WPA2 cracker (handshake → PBKDF2-SHA1, dual-core ESP32-S3)
- [ ] SSH shell via `libssh_esp32` (interactive remote terminal)
- [ ] LDAP domain dump (hand-rolled BER/DER LDAP client)
- [ ] Web crawler (HTTP spider + link extraction for internal web apps)
- [ ] SIP attack suite (scan/enumerate/spoof/flood/ring-all)
- [ ] CCTV toolkit (camera discovery + default credential spray)
- [ ] Skimmer detector (BLE OUI blocklist for payment card skimmers)
- [ ] Wall of Flipper (detect + counter-spam nearby Flipper Zeros)
- [ ] Pwnagotchi beacon spam (fake peer broadcasts)
- [ ] Open WiFi dashboard (association + internet connectivity test)
- [ ] UPnP NAT exploitation (AddPortMapping for firewall punching)

### Ongoing
- [ ] More .sub signal library contributions (community PRs welcome)
- [ ] Theme community — user-submitted color palettes
- [ ] DuckyScript full parser (not just -lite)
- [ ] Flipper .sub protocol-encoded format support (not just RAW)
- [ ] KeeLoq rolling code analysis (manufacturer key database)
- [ ] SD card USB mass storage mode (export captures without pulling card)
- [ ] ESP-NOW encrypted mesh (AES-256 between POSEIDON nodes)
- [ ] CI/CD: PlatformIO GitHub Actions build + auto-release .bin
